As time has passed on this beauty, each of its carefully picked tiles became an antiquity inscribed “Made in Al-Hijaz - Jeddah.”<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>All these fascinating details won’t take you away from its unique history.

To testify for its incredible architectural design, many artistic mockups are made of its highly crafted Rawashins. The merchant Suliman Qabil was able to single-handedly turn the Qabil Street into one of the most prominent and advanced streets of Jeddah at the time. In fact, it was the first street to be supplied with electricity. Till today, this area is considered one of the most significant locations in Jeddah due to its history and heritage.
