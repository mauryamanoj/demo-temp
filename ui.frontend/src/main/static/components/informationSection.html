  &#34;question&#34;: &#34;Can Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics help in satellite-based analysis of the rate of biodiversity loss of natural ecosystems?&#34;,
  &#34;answer&#34;: &#34;\u003ch1\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn your opinion, can the new technologies of Industry 4.0, including, above all, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning applied in combination with large sets of data, information and knowledge collected and processed on Big Data Analytics platforms, help in the satellite analysis of the rate of biodiversity loss of the planet\u0027s different natural ecosystems?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eAs part of the technological advances that have been taking place in recent years, which are also rapidly advancing as part of the development of ICT information technologies and Industry 4.0, more and more sophisticated analytical instruments and research techniques are being developed to carry out increasingly complex, multifaceted and Big Data-based analyses\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003ch3\u003e of the various processes taking place in nature and to obtain increasingly precise results from the research conducted. \u003c/h3\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch4\u003e\u0026nbsp;ecosystems carried out using satellites placed in planetary orbit are also being improved. Taking into account the negative\u003c/h4\u003e \n\u003ch4\u003e human impact on the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems that has been taking place since the beginning of the development of the first technological and industrial revolution,\u003c/h4\u003e \n\u003ch5\u003e and especially in the Anthropocene epoch from the mid-20th century onwards, there is a growing need to counteract these\u003c/h5\u003e \n\u003ch6\u003e negative processes, a need to increase the scale and outlays allocated to the improvement of nature conservation systems\u003c/h6\u003e \n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  and instruments, including the protection of the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems.\n \u003cbr\u003e \n\u003c/blockquote\u003e \n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nImproving nature conservation and biodiversity protection systems also requires cyclic surveys of the state of biodiversity of\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e \n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n individual terrestrial and marine natural ecosystems of the planet and analyses of progressive environmental degradation and the rate of biodiversity loss. In the situation of obtaining more precise results of research concerning changes in the state of the natural environment and the rate of loss of biodiversity of particular terrestrial and marine natural ecosystems of the planet occurring in various climate zones, changes in the state of the climate and diagnosing key civilisational determinants generating those changes, it is possible to apply specific actions and systemic solutions within the framework of counteracting negative processes of degradation of the natural environment and loss of biodiversity within the framework of improving nature protection techniques more effectively and adapted to the specific nature of a given local biosphere, climate conditions, diagnosed processes of the aforementioned changes but also economic factors. In this connection, the technology of artificial intelligence, which has been developing particularly rapidly in recent years, can also prove helpful in the process of improving the planning, design, management and restoration of natural ecosystems, taking into account a high degree of sustainability, biodiversity and naturalness, i.e. the restoration of natural ecosystems that existed in a specific area centuries ago. In the process of the aforementioned restoration of sustainable, highly biodiverse terrestrial and marine natural ecosystems of the planet, many primary factors must also be taken into account, including geological and climatic factors as well as the modifications previously applied to the area by man concerning geology, land irrigation, drainage, microclimate, soil quality, environmental pollution, the presence of certain invasive species of flora, fauna, fungi and microorganisms. Therefore, the process of planning, design, management and restoration of biodiverse natural ecosystems should take into account many of the above-mentioned factors that are a mix of natural biotic, climatic, \r\n\u003c/pre\u003e \n\u003cpre\u003e\r\ngeological and abiotic factors and changes in these factors that have taken place over the last centuries or millennia, i.e. changes and side-effects of the development of human, unsustainable civilisation, the development of a robber economy based on intensive industrial development with ignoring the issue of negative externalities towards the surrounding natural environment.\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e&#34;

On the other hand, due to the still high emissions of greenhouse gases generating the process of global warming, due to progressive climate change, increasingly frequent weather anomalies and climatic disasters, in addition to increasing environmental pollution, still rapidly decreasing areas of forests, carried out predatory forest management, the level of biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems is rapidly decreasing. Therefore, it is necessary to engage new technologies, including ICT information technologies, technologies categorized as Industry 4.0/Industry 5.0, including new technologies in the field of Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in order to improve and scale up the protection of the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow do the new technologies of Big Data Analytics and artificial intelligence, including deep learning based on artificial neural networks, help to protect the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhich new technologies, including ICT information technologies, technologies categorized as Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0 are helping to protect the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat are examples of new technologies that help protect the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow do new technologies help protect the biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd what is your opinion on this topic?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think about this topic?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePlease answer,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI invite everyone to join the discussion,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThank you very much,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWarm regards,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDariusz Prokopowicz\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe above text is entirely my own work written by me on the basis of my research.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn writing this text I did not use other sources or automatic text generation systems.\u003c/p\u003e&#34;

  &#34;question&#34;: &#34;Has the process of global warming in recent years accelerated faster than it was predicted just a few years ago? What, in your opinion, are the actions and projects that can contribute to forest conservation, to convert deforestation into afforestation, to protect the climate, biosphere and biodiversity of the planet\u0027s natural ecosystems, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and counteract the ongoing process of global warming?&#34;,
  &#34;answer&#34;: &#34;\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are the research results that support the thesis that as a result of human civilization, as a result of still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA growing number of research centers analyzing the planet\u0027s climate in the long term, analyzing the progressive process of climate change, developing long-term forecast models of climate change, changes in ocean water temps are publishing the results of their research, which show that as a result of human civilizational activity, as a result of still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted just a few years ago. These institutions include, among others, the international research team established at the UN and publishing IPCC reports. In addition to this, the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus also recently published the results of its ongoing research on the climate of planet Earth, which showed that in the 1st half of 2023, the average temp. of planet Earth\u0027s atmosphere was 16.8 degrees C. This is the highest temp. in the history of measurements. This is further evidence supporting the thesis that the global climate crisis has begun, and that the green economic transformation measures carried out in recent years, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, were definitely insufficient. In addition, in many countries, these actions have fallen far short of the pledges made at the UN Climate COP. Besides, the results of the aforementioned studies also support the thesis that the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted. This is a particularly important issue in the context of the living conditions of the next generations of people on the planet. Living conditions will rapidly deteriorate for many people on the planet in the not too distant future. Increasing summer heat, droughts, forest fires, weather anomalies, violent storms, drinking water shortages, deterioration of air quality, melting glaciers, rising water levels in the seas and oceans, shrinking areas of forests and other types of natural ecosystems, deterioration of the natural environment, progressive loss of biodiversity of natural ecosystems, extinction of pollinating insects and many other forms of life, etc. these are the key effects of the progressive global warming process, which will determine the deterioration of the quality of life on the planet for many people. In 2023 and 2024, the El Ninio effect is also an additional factor generating an increase in atmospheric temperature. However, according to the results of studies on the planet\u0027s climate, analyses of long-term climate change El Ninio is only an additional factor to the main factor is still the rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions generated by human civilization still based largely on the dirty combustion economy. However, there are many more research results also conducted by other institutions and research centers confirming the above theses. Please also provide other results of research conducted on this issue.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat are the results of research supporting the thesis that, as a result of human civilization, as a result of still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHas the process of global warming in recent years accelerated faster than it was predicted just a few years ago?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePlease answer,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI invite everyone to join the discussion,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThank you very much,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe above text is entirely my own work written by me on the basis of my research.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn writing this text I did not use other sources or automatic text generation systems.\u003c/p\u003e&#34;
